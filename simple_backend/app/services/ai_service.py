IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- The conversation below is a SPEECH-TO-TEXT TRANSCRIPT from an audio recording between a nurse and a patient
- The transcript may contain errors, mishearings, incomplete sentences, and background noise artifacts
- Medicine names are OFTEN INCORRECT in STT - use your medical knowledge to correct common Indian medicine names
- The conversation may be in Hindi, English, or mixed (Hinglish)
- Infer and extract medical information even from casual, colloquial language

TASK:
Convert this messy nurse-patient conversation into a clean, structured SOAP note.

CONVERSATION TRANSCRIPT (RAW STT OUTPUT):
{transcript}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Subjective**: Extract what the PATIENT says about their symptoms, complaints, history. Infer duration, severity, and triggers even if not explicitly stated.
2. **Objective**: Extract what the NURSE observes or measures - vitals (BP, temp, pulse), physical examination findings, visible symptoms. If not mentioned, write "Physical examination pending".
3. **Assessment**: Make a preliminary diagnosis or health assessment based on symptoms. Always provide your best medical inference - never leave empty.
4. **Plan**: Extract treatment recommendations, medicine prescriptions, follow-up instructions. Correct medicine names if they appear garbled (e.g., "Para sit a mole" → "Paracetamol", "met for min" → "Metformin").
5. **Chief Complaint**: One concise sentence summarizing the main medical issue.
6. **Medications**: List all medicines mentioned with corrected spellings.

MEDICINE NAME CORRECTION EXAMPLES:
- "para sit a mole", "para c tamol" → "Paracetamol"
- "met for min", "metform in" → "Metformin"
- "amal dip in", "a modo pin" → "Amlodipine"
- "see pro flex a sin", "sipro" → "Ciprofloxacin"
- "az throw my sin" → "Azithromycin"
- "d cloud phenac" → "Diclofenac"

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks):
{{
    "subjective": "Patient's main complaints and symptoms in their own words",
    "objective": "Observable facts: vitals, physical examination findings",

    "chief_complaint": "Primary reason for visit (one sentence)",
    "medications": ["List any medications mentioned"],
    "language": "hindi/english/mixed"
}}

NEVER use "Not documented" - always infer something meaningful from the conversation.
Be concise, medically accurate, and professionally worded.
